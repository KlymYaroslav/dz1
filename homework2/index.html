<h1 style="background: blue;color: gold;font-size: 50px;">The biographick John Cooper</h1>
<p style="color: #ee0c0c;background: black;font-size: 20px;">
    John Landrum Cooper (born April 7, 1975) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He has been the lead
    vocalist, bassist and co-founder of Christian rock band Skillet since 1996 and the only constant member, and his
    side project Fight the Fury since 2018.ohn Cooper has stated on numerous occasions that he was born and raised in a
    very religious family and atmosphere, and listening to rock music was not allowed in his parents' household.[10]
    "You couldn't wear black, you couldn't listen to anything with drums, anything with guitars, you couldn't have long
    hair, you couldn't do this and you couldn't do that. Everything was so lifeless. I know I'd read the Bible and be
    like... 'This isn't what the Bible says. I like the idea of living for Jesus, but I hate the idea of living for
    you.' Ya know?"[11]

<p style="background: black; color: #ee0c0c; font-size: 20px;">
    <b>Cooper</b> came from a musical family. His mother was a piano teacher and a singer in the church that he went to.
    He
    began singing at a very young age, playing guitar at around the age of 18 and bass guitar at the age of 19.Cooper is
    married to his wife, Korey. As of 2016, the couple have two children.Cooper has been an outspoken critic of the
    "deconstruction movement" (a phenomenon which has led many Christian celebrities to abandon their faith, most
    notably author Joshua Harris and musicians Marty Sampson, Jonathan Steingard and Kevin Max), believing that many
    churches are neglecting to teach the gospel as written in the Bible:"It is time for the church to rediscover the
    preeminence of the Word. And to value the teaching of the Word. We need to value truth over feeling. Truth over
    emotion."

<p style="background: orange; color: black;">
    <strong><i><b>Cooper</b></i> was briefly in experimental rock group Seraph from 1989-1995. The band released a
        four-song
        demo, titled
        Silence E.P., before disbanding. The track listing was "Alone", "Silence", "Wild Honey", and "Fading Love".[1]

        <b>Cooper</b> formed Skillet in 1996 with Ken Steorts. Both had met while touring for previous bands; Cooper as
        vocalist
        for the Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph and Steorts as guitarist for Urgent Cry. The bands disbanded soon
        after, so Cooper and Steorts' pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from
        different
        styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. Soon afterward Trey McClurkin joined the band
        as
        a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian
        record
        label ForeFront Records and were signed soon afterward. Ken Steorts left the band in 1999 and Trey McClurkin
        left
        the band in 2000 leaving Cooper as the only founding member of the band and primary songwriter.

        <b>Cooper</b> provided vocals for !Hero: The Rock Opera. According to a review, Cooper did not tour with the
        rock
        opera, he
        only provided vocals for the Rabbi Kai on the soundtrack.[2] Cooper was the co-writer of the Decyfer Down single
        "Best I Can".[3]

        He sang on the title track of tobyMac's album, Tonight, which peaked at No. 27 on the Christian Songs
        chart.[4][5]
        He performed vocals on We as Human's song, on "Zombie",[6] which appeared on their debut self-titled album and
        made
        a cameo appearance in the music video for "Strike Back".[7] He signed them to his record label.[6]

        <b>Cooper</b> started a side project, Fight the Fury, in September 2018. He hopes the band will meet the needs
        of
        those who
        enjoy Skillet's heavier music. The band released an EP on Atlantic Records later in 2018 and then went on tour
        in
        Russia in December.[8] As of October 27, 2018, They have released five songs.</strong>
