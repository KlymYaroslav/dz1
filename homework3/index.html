    <p><b>Leonardo da Vinci[b]</b> (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was
        active as a
        painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect.[3] While his fame initially rested
        on
        his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a
        variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo's
        genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal,[4] and his collective works compose a contribution to later
        generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.[3][4]
    <p>
        Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in
        Florence
        by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much
        time
        in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in
        Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he
        spent
        his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his
        achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and
        admiration,[3][4] making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.</p>
    <p>
        Leonardo is among the greatest painters in the history of art and is often credited as the founder of the High
        Renaissance.[3] Despite having many lost works and less than 25 attributed major works—including numerous
        unfinished
        works—he created some of the most influential paintings in Western art.[3] His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is
        his
        best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced
        religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017,
        Salvator
        Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,[5] was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new
        record
        for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.</p>
    <p>
        Revered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle,
        concentrated solar power, an adding machine,[6] and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were
        constructed
        or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were
        only in
        their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of
        manufacturing
        unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. He made
        substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did
        not
        publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.[7]</p>

    <p><b>Birth and background</b>
        Photo of a building of rough stone with small windows, surrounded by olive trees
        The possible birthplace and childhood home of Leonardo in Anchiano, Vinci, Italy
        Leonardo da Vinci,[b] properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (Leonardo, son of ser Piero from
        Vinci),[8][9][c] was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci; Florence was 20 miles
        away.[10][11][d] He was born out of wedlock to Ser Piero da Vinci [fr] (Ser Piero di Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser
        Guido da Vinci; 1426–1504),[15] a Florentine legal notary,[10] and Caterina [it] (c. 1434 – 1494), from the
        lower-class.[16][17][e] It remains uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral
        tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti,[20] is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that
        would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a
        house
        in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had.[21][a] Leonardo's parents both married separately the year
        after
        his birth. Caterina—who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only "Caterina" or "Catelina"—is usually identified
        as
        the Caterina Buti del Vacca who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed
        "L'Accattabriga" ("the quarrelsome one").[16][20] Other theories have been proposed, particularly that of art
        historian Martin Kemp, who suggested Caterina di Meo Lippi, an orphan that married supposably with aid from Ser
        Piero and his family.[22][f] Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori—having been betrothed to her the previous
        year—and
        after her death in 1462, went on to have three subsequent marriages.[20][23][g] From all the marriages, Leonardo
        eventually had 12 half-siblings who were much younger than he was (the last was born when Leonardo was 40 years
        old)
        and with whom he had very little contact.[h]
    <p>
        Very little is known about Leonardo's childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of his biography
        in
        the frequently apocryphal Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1550) from the
        16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari.[26][27] Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 he lived in the
        household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci,[10] but it is possible that he spent the years before
        then
        in the care of his mother in Vinci, either Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San Pantaleone.[28][29] He
        is
        thought to have been close to his uncle, Francesco da Vinci,[3] but his father was likely in Florence most of
        the
        time.[10] Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an official residence in
        Florence by at least 1469 and led a successful career.[10] Despite his family history, Leonardo only received a
        basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading and mathematics, possibly because his artistic
        talents
        were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention there.[10]</p>
    <p>
        Later in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus.[30] While writing on the
        flight
        of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth with its tail;
        commentators
        still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.[31]</p>

<div class="yyy"><h3 style="text-align: center">Personal life</h3>
    <p>Despite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his
        personal
        life.[2]
    <p>
        Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his "great physical beauty" and "infinite
        grace,"
        as described by Vasari,[‡ 5] as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One
        such
        aspect was his love for animals, likely including vegetarianism and according to Vasari, a habit of purchasing
        caged
        birds and releasing them.[93][‡ 6]</p>
    <p>
        Leonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical significance,
        including
        mathematician Luca Pacioli,[94] with whom he collaborated on the book Divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo
        appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the
        two
        Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella.[95] While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of
        Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.[35]</p>
    <p>
        Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire,
        analysis,
        and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most
        notably by Sigmund Freud in his Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood.[96] Leonardo's most intimate
        relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salaì and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his
        death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the
        16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged
        twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a
        well-known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since
        one
        of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to
        secure the dismissal.[97] Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality[98] and its
        role in
        his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more
        explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.</p>

<div class="lll"><h4 style="text-align: center; color: orange">Paintings of the 1490s</h4>
    <p>Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of
        Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his
        capture
        and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said "one of you will betray me", and the consternation that
        this statement caused.[36]
    <p>
        The writer Matteo Bandello observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk
        without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.[109] This was beyond the
        comprehension
        of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how
        Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the
        duke
        that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.[‡ 7]</p>
    <p>
        The painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterization,[‡ 8] but it deteriorated rapidly, so
        that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as "completely ruined."[110] Leonardo, instead of
        using
        the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface
        subject to mould and to flaking.[111] Despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of
        art;
        countless copies have been made in various mediums.</p>
    <p>
        Toward the end of this period, in 1498 da Vinci's trompe-l'œil decoration of the Sala delle Asse was painted for
        the
        Duke of Milan in the Sforza Castle.</p>
