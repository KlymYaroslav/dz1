    A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five
    Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze
    (with his wife Kushina Uzumaki) seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a
    host of the beast;[i] this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become
    the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due
    to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails
    until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in
    combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii]
<p>
    Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura
    Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like
    all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing
    chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.</p>
<p>
    After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam,
    enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the
    exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the
    three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to
    become Fifth Hokage instead.</p>
<p>
    During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage,
    the Sharingan. [iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi[iv], who had showed up in
    Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story
    takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke,
    but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto
    leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while
    Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice. </p>

<p><b>Part II</b>

    Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts
    of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke.
    The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara,
    who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in
    battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy
    his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this
    revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki
    members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems
    him, earning the village's respect and admiration.
<p>
    With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to
    capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace.
    The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and
    allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries
    (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto,
    unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and
    escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of
    Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.</p>
<p>
    During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be
    dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha,
    including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto
    and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an
    ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her.
    Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the
    Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him
    from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the
    war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while
    Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.</p>
